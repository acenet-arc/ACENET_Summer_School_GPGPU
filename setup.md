This lesson will work best if done on a real cluster, like Compute Canada's BÃ©luga, Cedar, or Graham.
If you haven't got an account on those, our virtual training cluster will also be fine
although some of the profiling exercises might not work as described.

~~~
ssh userXX@pcs2.ace-net.training
~~~
{: .bash}

To set up your environment, load the NVidia HPC Software Development Kit and CUDA with:

~~~
module load StdEnv/2020
module load nvhpc/20.7
~~~
{: .bash}

You should have access to the compiler and tools now. Test this with:

~~~
which nvcc
which nvprof
~~~
{: .bash}
