In the Hello World example we saw the `<<<M,N>>>` syntax used in CUDA to call a
kernel function, and learned that it creates M blocks and N threads per block.
In the Adding Vectors example we just finished, we used create threads
with `<<<1,N>>>`. Now we will use the first parameter to create blocks
instead.

What's a block? A GPU typically has several _streaming multiprocessors_
(SMs). A block is handled by one SM, though each SM may handle many blocks in
succession.  And each SM supports up to 1024 threads, typically in multiples of 32.
See the 
<a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html">CUDA
C Programming Guide</a> for pictures (Figures 3,4).  Threads can quickly access
and share the data within a block.

The P100 GPU model available at 
<a href="https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Graham">Graham</a>
and <a href="https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cedar">Cedar</a>
has 56 SMs, each supporting 64 single-precision threads or 32 double-precision
threads. So if you are doing double-precision calculations, each GPU has
effectively 56*32 = 1792 cores.
At <a href="https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/B%C3%A9luga/en">BÃ©luga</a>
there are newer
<a href="https://videocardz.com/69378/nvidia-announces-tesla-v100-with-5120-cuda-cores">V100 GPUs</a>
with 80 SMs, which again support 64 single-precision or 32
double-precision threads each, for 2560 effective cores.

But to take advantage of all these "CUDA cores" you need to use both blocks and threads.

Let's change the kernel function to use CUDA's block index,
`blockIdx.x`. This changes the function definition to be the following:

~~~
__global__ void add(int *a, int *b, int *c) {
   c[blockIdx.x] = a[blockIdx.x] + b[blockIdx.x];
}

The point of using a GPU is speed, so how do we measure the speed of
our kernel code and the various CUDA calls like `cudaMemcpy`?  CUDA
provides the utility `nvprof` for this.  Here's some sample output:

This tells us the GPU spent 3.1040 microseconds in our `add()` kernel,
but spent slightly longer (3.1360us) just copying the data from the
host to the device, and then half that again copying the results back.
You might also note that, among the "API calls", `cudaMalloc` takes 99%
of the time!

This should drive home what we meant when we said the GPU is for
*arithmetically intense* operations.  All the examples we've done in this
workshop are *too small*.  They could have been done just as quickly and even
more simply on the CPU--- but that is often the nature of example problems!

Getting your data on to and off of the GPU is the price you pay to access the
massive parallelism of the GPU.  To make that worth while, you have to need to
do a **lot** of arithmetic!  And your program should be designed in such a way
that data movement between main memory and GPU is minimized.  Ideally the data
moves onto the GPU *once*, and moves off *once*.

Nonetheless, as long as you bear in mind which parts of these problems are 
artificial, you can still use `nvprof` to answer some interesting questions, like,
"Is it faster to use threads or blocks?"
